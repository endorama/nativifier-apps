# Nativifier Applications

[nativifier](https://github.com/jiahaog/Nativefier) creates native wrappers around web applications.

But creating wrappers is not that easy. Most websites don't like being put in a cage and integration with the OS as a
whole is generally lacking.

Fortunately nativifier provides more than one way to improve on this.

This repository wants to act as a colletion of natifivied applications for Linux platform.
